Today i want to introduce a little bandwith measure tool to you. `iperf`is a tool to measure the bandwith between to systems. It is a client/server application, so you need to install it on both sides. To install this little guy, i use the standard repository from the system iam working on. On a RHEL you need to add the [epel-repo](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) to the machines. On ubuntu or debian you would probably use

```shell
sudo apt-get install iperf
```

After you have installed it on both sides, you have to start the server on one side. You could do it like that

```shell
iperf -s
# if you want to use another port
iperf -s -p 12345
```

Now you should see something like that (i used the standardport in this example)

```shell
[root@weichert ~] # iperf -s
------------------------------------------------------------
Server listening on TCP port 5001
TCP window size: 85.3 KByte (default)
------------------------------------------------------------
```

On the other side you connect with iperf to the server and start the test. With the parameter `-r` you start a bidirectional test. With `-P 5` you will open 5 parallel client threads. The parameter `-w` will change the tcp window size.
Okay let's have a look on a simple test with iperf.

```shell
# Start the test on clientside
[root@test-vm ~] # iperf -c weichert.it -P 5
------------------------------------------------------------
Client connecting to weichert.it, TCP port 5001
TCP window size: 2.50 MByte (default)

So far so good, but what if there is no iperf installed, or you cannot install it because of other restrictions? [Take a look to dd](https://www.weichert.it/en/test-your-bandwidth-with-dd-orand-netcat/). I wrote an short article to test bandwith with DD and/or Netcat.
