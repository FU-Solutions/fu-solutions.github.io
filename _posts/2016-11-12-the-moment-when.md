â€¦ you have to contact a Network Delivery Leadâ€¦
![](https://www.serieslyawesome.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Star-Trek-Facepalm.gif)

This week i had to contact a network specialist from a big international company. Magnificentâ€¦ We can't reach a destination over their vpn-tunnel.
I send him the IP-addresses from the source and destination, also a netcat to the destination ip and port... only with ip addresses. No DNS-Names.
